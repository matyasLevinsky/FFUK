The attack at Charles University came after authorities received some prior warning about a student at the school, according to the country's head of police, though an investigation into key details of the shooting is just beginning. Here's what we know so far: The attack had a devastating toll: At least 14 people were killed and 25 others wounded, according to the latest update provided by police. Authorities revised the number of those killed and hurt in the attack as their investigation unfolded and victims received treatment at hospitals. At least 10 of those wounded are in serious condition, officials said. The victims were gunned down at Charles University, located in the busy tourist center of Prague.
The shooter is dead: Early reports indicate the shooter took his own life after the attack, but that is not yet confirmed, Czech Police President Martin Vondrášek said in a news conference. The shooter has not been formally identified because of the severity of his injuries, the police chief said, but investigators believe they know his identity. The suspect is a 24-year-old philosophy student at the school who had a gun permit and several weapons, Vondrášek said.
Police were tipped off about the suspect: Authorities received a tip saying the suspect was traveling from his hometown of Hostouň to Prague intending to take his own life, police said. Shortly after that, they learned that a man believed to be the suspect's father was found dead in Hostouň, which is about 100 miles from the Czech capital.
Officials had evacuated a different school building: Police were aware the suspected shooter had a lecture at 2 p.m. CET (8 a.m. ET) Thursday and had evacuated the building where the lecture was meant to take place, Vondrášek said. But then police received a call about a shooting in a different building on campus, according to the police chief.
Students scrambled to escape the gunfire: Police said it took time to help students safely evacuate after the shooting, as some had locked themselves in classrooms. A group of students climbed out of a classroom window and hid on the ledge of the university's Faculty of Arts building in an attempt to escape, a photo on social media showed.
Officials expressed shock at the violence: Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala expressed his condolences to the loved ones of the victims and said there was "absolutely no explanation, no justification" for the "senseless attack." He said it was believed to be an isolated incident and not an act of terror or attack by an organized group. Other European leaders also condemned the violence and expressed shock at the attack.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Live updates: Prague mass shooting at Charles Universityheadline:Czech Republic announces day of mourning for shooting victims</teiHeader><text>The Czech Republic will observe a day of mourning Saturday for those killed in the Prague shooting, officials announced at a joint news conference Thursday.

Luckily, Weizman managed to finally get the door locked, he said. Moments later, they started pushing classroom furniture up to the door to create a barricade. "About five minutes after that, someone tried to open the door very violently," Weizman said. He believes it may have been the shooter, but he does not know for sure. Weizman, who told CNN he lived in the United States for 15 years, never thought he would experience a mass shooting event in Europe.  "You think it will never happen," he said. "I'm still processing a lot." The graduate student said the police eventually arrived, so he broke down the barricade to let them in.

Law enforcement sources said a search of the suspect's last known address was conducted by FBI SWAT teams Thursday.
Robert Card, 40, is facing an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder and should be considered armed and dangerous, police said. He is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserves, according to law enforcement.
Police are urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Lewiston is the state's second-largest city and is located about 36 miles north of Portland.
The rampage in Maine is the deadliest US mass shooting since the Uvalde school massacre. It adds to a grim docket of 565 such incidents, where four or more people are shot excluding the shooter, across the country this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:NA</teiHeader><text>Our live coverage of the hunt for the suspect in the Maine mass shooting has moved here</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:What to know about Lewiston, the small city where the shooting rampage unfolded</teiHeader><text>A shooting rampage in Lewiston, Maine, left 18 dead and 13 more injured Wednesday evening after a gunman opened fire on a bowling alley and a restaurant.  Lewiston is a sprawling residential and industrial area just off the Maine Turnpike and is home to two hospitals and the private liberal arts school Bates College. It’s a largely working-class community, with a median household income of about $48,000 and in which about 16% of the population lives in poverty, according to the US Census. Maine Gov. Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Father of 2-year-old identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston mass shootings</teiHeader><text>Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.  Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad. Now my brother is not here anymore along with 17 other people,” Brewer told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just went to play cornhole. He is the nicest person you would ever meet. He never had a bad thing to say about anyone.” Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated his daughter Elle's second birthday.  In the past five years, Brewer-Ross worked his way through the iron pipefitter apprenticeship program and graduated last year. When he wasn’t spending time with his family, he enjoyed comics, cornhole, playing games and having fun with friends, his brother said.  “We are walking around in a daze not knowing what to say, what to do, or how to act, because of a senseless shooting,” Brewer said. “It’s so unbelievable that this can continue to happen over and over again and nothing changes.”</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Lisbon residents asked to continue sheltering in place overnight as manhunt for suspected gunman continues</teiHeader><text>The town of Lisbon, Maine, is asking residents to continue to shelter in place throughout the overnight hours as officials continue to search for the suspect in Wednesday night's deadly mass shooting.

She also cited a slew of executive orders President Joe Biden has signed as president to address gun violence, but acknowledged, “the president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.” Looking forward, Jean-Pierre said Biden “will continue to do everything in his power to protect the American people to protect our communities to protect our children, and we urge— we urge congressional Republicans to come to the table to come to the table if there truly is common ground at this time.” Jean-Pierre declined to say if Biden plans to visit Lewiston, Maine. She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Law enforcement response time is missing from Lewiston shootings timeline</teiHeader><text>Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

She said the administration will continue to provide support to local authorities as the investigation into the shootings uncovers what happened. An intensive manhunt is still underway for suspect Robert Card, 40, who faces an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder. Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States, firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”  Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added. Australia has long been referenced in the ongoing debate over how to stop mass shootings in the US. It passed nationwide gun control in 2006 after a lone gunman in Tasmania killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the span of 90 seconds. In a written statement later Thursday, Harris cited the newly-formed White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention as a way the Biden administration "will continue to work to save lives" until legislation is passed.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Bates College postpones inauguration celebration for new president after Lewiston shooting rampage</teiHeader><text>On Friday, Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was scheduled to host inauguration celebrations for its new president, Garry W.

This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”   The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.   Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.  “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”  Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.   Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”  Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.  Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Maine senator says she's in touch with Biden and administration officials to coordinate response to rampage</teiHeader><text>GOP Sen.

The off-duty workers also helped treat people who were already in the hospital when it faced a sudden uptick in demand for trauma care. Nurses and physicians from other area hospitals joined the emergency response, along with ambulance services from other counties, Alexander said. At one point, Central Maine Medical Center had as many as 10 ambulance crews standing by outside the hospital's trauma center to ensure it could transfer any patients needed, according to Alexander. Nearby Boston and Dartmouth medical centers contributed extra helicopter services. "We were able to organize those resources and use them effectively," Alexander said of the sudden flood of support.

McGee told CNN's Shimon Prokupecz during an impromptu interview that his team has been responding to calls “all night long” from concerned citizens. “A lot of calls, a lot of calls.” “It’s what we want them doing right now,” he told CNN, “if they see anything suspicious.” McGee said authorities have a lot of information they are working with but would not comment on the suspect or whether he knows the area.  “Everybody’s involved we’re just trying to keep the community safe — obviously this is a very tragic incident that happened — we’re doing our job to the best of our abilities to locate this suspect.” “I would say we’re going to not stop until we get him.” He urged the media and public to “stay near your vehicles” for their safety. The vehicle connected to Robert Card, identified by police as a person of interest in the mass shooting, was located in Lisbon Wednesday night, according to Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck. Lisbon is about 8 miles from Lewiston. Here's what we know about the manhunt:  A "person of interest": Lewiston police said Card should be “considered armed and dangerous." Law enforcement officials in Maine say Card is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserve. Card had recently made threats to carry out a shooting at a National Guard facility in Saco, Maine, and also reported mental health issues, including hearing voices, the officials said.

State officials say the shootings began around 6:56 p.m. ET. Eyewitnesses described seeing people running away from the bowling alley. Lewiston is about 36 miles north of Portland and is the state’s second-largest city. A local councilor who spoke to CNN said the death toll could be as high as 22.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said. CNN's Annette Choi, Eric Levenson and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this report.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Maine police advise residents of Bowdoin to shelter in place as search continues for shooting suspect</teiHeader><text>Residents of Bowdoin, Maine, were advised not to go outside early Thursday as the search continues for a person of interest in a deadly mass shooting in nearby Lewiston.

Just in Time Recreation, which was previously known as Sparetime Recreation, had families enjoying the evening playing games when the shooting began. Eyewitnesses described seeing people, including children, flee from the location and being patted down outside by police officers. There was also footage of first responders loading a victim into an ambulance outside the business. The business lies just off the main highway that runs through Lewiston. Amenities include a bar and dining area that serves pizzas and burgers, according to its website. It also offers packages for birthday parties and corporate events, it says.  Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant, the second shooting location, hosts parties, family celebrations and corporate events — with an arcade area that includes dart boards and pool tables, according to its website.

It's home to Bates College, a private liberal arts school, and is regularly ranked as one of America's safest cities. “We know that these events have shocked and frightened our community. And we grieve for those whose lives were tragically lost in this heinous act of violence,” Bates College said in a statement late Wednesday, referring to the mass shooting. Lewiston is the second biggest city in Maine, after Portland, and sits on the banks of the Androscoggin River.  And though Maine is the whitest state in the nation, according to the 2020 census, immigrant communities have grown in size recently, as well as in other states including Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington.  Between 2017 and 2021, more than 7% of Lewiston residents were foreign-born, according to the census — still lower than the national average of nearly 14%. And in those years, 19% of Lewiston residents spoke a language other than English at home.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Lewiston public schools and nearby districts cancel classes on Thursday</teiHeader><text>As police continue to search for a person of interest involved in the Lewiston shootings, which left at least 22 dead Wednesday night, local schools have announced they will cancel classes on Thursday.  "There remains a lot of unknowns at this time.

The deputy chief said at least 150 rounds of ammunition were fired as the gunman fired indiscriminately as he walked through the neighborhood on Monday.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: 3 killed in Farmington, New Mexico shootingheadline:Suspect was not on police's radar, police chief says</teiHeader><text>The suspect was not previously on local police's radar, according to Deputy Police Chief Kyle Dowdy.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: 3 killed in Farmington, New Mexico shootingheadline:Suspect shot indiscriminately at 3 vehicles and at least 6 houses, police say</teiHeader><text>The suspect in Monday’s mass shooting roamed a Farmington, New Mexico, neighborhood and fired "indiscriminately" at vehicles and at least six houses, Deputy Police Chief Kyle Dowdy said Tuesday during a news conference. “Hundreds of people” called to report the shooting, which began Monday morning just before 11 a.m., Dowdy said.

"One day this will make more sense," Hale wrote. "I've left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen," the message stated.  "I tried to comfort and encourage her and subsequently reached out to the Suicide Prevention Help Line after being instructed to by my father at 10:08 am," Patton said.  Patton tells WTVF that she she called the Nashville Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13 a.m. to make them aware of the situation and was instructed to call Nashville's non-emergency number.  "I called Nashville's non-emergency line at 10:14 a.m. and was on hold for nearly seven minutes before speaking with someone who said that they would send an officer to my home.

If you are just reading in, here's the latest on the shooting and investigation:  The shooter: The person was identified as 28-year-old Audrey Hale. Hale was shot and killed by police during the Monday attack, and left behind “drawn out” maps of the Covenant School detailing “how this was all going to take place,” Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. As police work to piece together what led up to the violence, officials said they had determined where the shooter lived in the Nashville area and have interviewed Hale’s father.  Hale, who attended the Christian school years ago, left writings that pertain to the shooting and had scouted a second possible attack location in Nashville, “but because of a threat assessment by the suspect – there’s too much security – they decided not to,” police chief said.The writings revealed that the attack at Covenant School “was calculated and planned,” Metro Nashville said. So far, little is known about the shooter. Hale graduated from Nossi College of Art & Design in Nashville last year, the president of the school confirmed to CNN, and a LinkedIn profile says Hale worked as a freelance graphic designer and a part-time grocery shopper. Police have referred to Hale as the “female shooter” and at an evening press conference added that Hale was transgender. When asked for clarification, a spokesperson told CNN Hale used “male pronouns” on a social media profile. The weapons: The shooter was “someone that had multiple rounds of ammunition, prepared for confrontation with law enforcement, prepared to do more harm than was actually done,” the police chief said in a news conference. Three weapons – an AR-style rifle, an AR-style pistol and a handgun – were found and police believe Hale obtained at least two of the weapons legally, Drake said. A search warrant executed at Hale’s home also resulted in the seizure of a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other evidence, according to police. The victims: All three students shot and killed were 9 years old. They were identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Three adults killed in the shooting were identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said. Two Covenant School employees are among the victims of Monday’s mass shooting, according to the school. What is expected to happen today: Investigators were expected to spend Tuesday processing the scene and gathering more details about what happened during the roughly 14 minutes of terror at the elementary school. Mass shootings in America: The attack marked the 19th shooting at a school or university so far in 2023 in which at least one person was wounded, according to a CNN tally. With six victims, the shooting at Covenant is the deadliest school shooting since the attack in Uvalde, Texas, last May left 21 people dead.

On Monday, it was Nashville’s turn to join the roster of cities made notorious by a mass shooting epidemic much of the country seems prepared to tacitly accept as the price of the right to own high-powered firearms.  The reality of what unfolded inside was inhuman, but it can unfortunately be imagined given the gruesome insider accounts that emerged from previous school shootings — in Uvalde, Texas, last year, or at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, were gunned down by a shooter armed with two AR-style weapons and a handgun, two of which police said were bought legally. Their names — known only to the rest of America in death — were released by police about the same time as they should have been going home from Covenant School for the day. Three staff, all half a century older, also died. They were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61. They were all murdered in the place that should be the safest: where kids go to school. But a plague of recent classroom rampages, distinguished even among America’s gun violence by their depravity, shows that nowhere is really secure.

The students who were killed were all 9 years old, police said. The shooter, who was identified as a 28-year-old former student of the school, was also killed in a shootout with police. Here's what we know so far: About Covenant School: The school is a private Christian school founded in 2001 as a ministry of Covenant Presbyterian Church. It has an average enrollment of about 200 people in recent years, according to its website, and it teaches preschool through 6th grade.
What happened: Don Aaron, spokesperson for the Metro Nashville Police Department, said the first calls of an active shooting came in at around 10:15 a.m. local time. When officers arrived, they went through the first level of the building, he said. They then heard gunshots coming from the second level of the building, according to Aaron. He said that's where police confronted and killed the shooter at 10:27 a.m. local time.
The shooter: The shooter has been identified as 28-year-old Nashville resident Audrey Hale. The shooter was armed with a handgun and two AR-style weapons — one a rifle and an AR-style pistol, Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. Two of those may have been obtained legally and locally in Nashville, Drake said. According to initial findings, the shooter was once a student at the school, he added, though he said police are unsure what years. 
Prior planning: The shooter had drawn detailed maps of Covenant School, Drake said, including the entry points to the building and detailing "how this was all gonna take place." Drake said police believe the shooter shot through one of the doors to get into the school. Drake said the school was the only location targeted by the shooter. Police have also located writings that they are reviewing.
The victims: The three students who were shot and killed at Covenant School were all 9 years old, police said. They have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, according to police. Three adults were also killed in the shooting. They have been identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce and 61-year-old Mike Hill, police said.
What's next: Police will spend the next two days processing the scene and working to gather more details about what happened during a shooting at a Nashville elementary school, Aaron said, adding police also intend to release video soon. Officials said they knew where the shooter lived and they have interviewed the shooter's father.
Call for gun safety legislation: President Joe Biden called the shooting at a Nashville school "heartbreaking, a family's worst nightmare," while advocating for gun reform. Biden said Congress needs to pass an assault weapons ban because we "need to do more to protect our schools." However, a bipartisan solution is extremely unlikely this Congress with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate and a GOP-led House. Nashville Mayor John Cooper said too many children are dying from guns and that the community needs to come together to support each other.
Mass shootings in America: There have been at least 130 mass shooting in the US so far in 2023, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. The Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: March 27, 2023 Nashville Covenant School shooting newsheadline:Presbyterian Church in America sends "heartfelt concerns and prayers" to shooting victims</teiHeader><text>In a statement sent to CNN, Bryan Chapell of the Presbyterian Church in America expressed the church's condolences to the victims of the Covenant School shooting.

The president, who was speaking at Small Business Administration’s Women’s Business Summit Monday, said more needs to be done to stop gun violence. The shooting took place at the Covenant School, a private Christian elementary school in Nashville that teaches preschool through 6th grade, Nashville police said.  Officials said the shooter was armed with at least two "assault-type" rifles and a handgun. Biden called on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, saying we "need to do more to protect our schools." “It's about time we began to make some more progress," he said. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, echoed the president’s remarks, saying he strongly supports "bills to ban assault weapons from civilian use and to close gaps in our background check system.” He urged lawmakers to come up with a bipartisan solution, but that is extremely unlikely this Congress with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate and a GOP-led House. Last year the Senate passed the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” the first major piece of legislation to address gun violence since 1994. The legislation fell short of what some Democrats had hoped for, including their long hope of banning assault weapons.

A female shooter was killed by police after killing three students and three adults at the Covenant School, according to Nashville Police Department spokesperson Don Aaron. Any legislation to pass comprehensive gun legislation faces an uphill battle in a divided Congress, while the Republican-controlled House has shown little interest in gun control legislation.

Authorities say two juveniles remain in custody while police investigate the violence that overshadowed the celebration. A third person, an adult, was released Thursday after officials deemed them uninvolved in the shooting.
About a million fans were in downtown Kansas City for the parade, and players were still on the stage of the victory rally when the shooting took place.
The shooting was at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  We've wrapped up our live coverage for the evening.

Here's what we know so far, as investigation continues</teiHeader><text>Police are investigating a shooting that killed one person and wounded more than 20 others on Wednesday. The shooting happened after a rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win. Here's what we know so far: Victims: The woman killed has been identified as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a local DJ and a mom of two kids, according to her family and police. More than 20 others were hurt, ranging from 8 to 47 years old, according to Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves. Half of those people were under the age of 16, she added. A majority of the patients admitted to University Health Truman Medical Center and Children's Mercy Kansas City have been discharged, hospital officials.
What happened: The shooting was a personal dispute between "several people" in which others were wounded, Graves said. She said there was no link to terrorism or homegrown extremism.
No one charged: Initially, police detained three people for further investigation — one adult and two juveniles, according to Graves. The adult was released Thursday afternoon after police determined they were not involved, a spokesperson for the police department said. Two juveniles still in custody have not yet been charged, but police are working with juvenile prosecutors to "review investigative findings," officials added.
Ongoing investigation: Bullets and shell casings left behind at the scene of the shooting are key pieces of evidence being analyzed to determine a possible connection to the people in police custody as well as any other possible suspects, a law enforcement source told CNN. Police said they recovered an unspecified number of guns. ATF investigators will also look at whether the bullets or shell casings match any of those firearms or any weapons in databases, according to the source.
Witness accounts: One man said he overheard an altercation before the shooting where a woman told a presumed shooter, "Don’t do it, not here; this is stupid." He said the person pulled out a gun and "started shooting and spinning in a circle," Jacob Gooch, Sr. told CBS' Gayle King. Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Trey Smith told ABC he found shelter in a closet and guided others to safety.

This is everything we know so far: Shooting in large crowd: An estimated 1 million people gathered Wednesday just steps from Union Station in Kansas City for the parade and rally to mark the Chiefs’ repeat championship win, with players still on the stage when the chaos erupted. A victory rally following the parade featured several players toasting the team’s connection with the city. The event wrapped up, and then, gunshots rang out.
Police investigation: Police now are collecting physical and digital evidence and interviewing witnesses and victims, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives both responded to Kansas City to help police, a Justice Department spokesperson said. The FBI has set up a website asking for tips or videos.
Three detained: Three people were detained and an unspecified number of guns recovered as officers converged, said Graves. No charges have been announced and no suspects have been named. “We do not have a motive, but we are asking those who may potentially have any kind of information, a witness or video, to contact police,” the chief said at a Wednesday news conference.

Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory "CJ" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby "after assaulting the victims in the office area." Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on "his training and his character" and that he "never hesitates." Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. 
What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them "trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.
Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live-streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shootingheadline:Louisville mayor says he is talking to state lawmakers about how to address gun violence</teiHeader><text>Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he is already talking with state lawmakers from both parties about gun reform, one day after a mass shooting at a bank killed five people in his city.

While there is a spirit of coming together, he said, “I'm also hopeful we are taking action.” “We have had enough gun violence in Louisville. We have had enough gun violence in our country and it’s time to take action,” he said, pledging to work with other elected officials and community leaders.  Greenberg wants either statewide action in Kentucky or a change to state laws that would allow him to pass reforms in just his city. While he has had preliminary conversations with lawmakers at the state capital on both sides of the aisle, he said more meetings are expected to happen in the coming days to “talk about what we can do together” Police released several minutes of officer body camera video Tuesday evening. And Greenberg said two things stood out to him about the footage — first is the bravery of the officers who ran into the building, and the second was the tragedy of watching the events unfold. “Our city is heartbroken” for those killed, the mayor said when asked how the community is reacting.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shootingheadline:Victim Juliana Farmer only started her job at the Louisville bank 3 weeks ago, her aunt says</teiHeader><text>Juliana Farmer, one of the five people killed in a Louisville bank on Monday, is being remembered by her family as someone who loved life. “Her siblings, they lost a sister.

Here's what to know</teiHeader><text>Body camera footage showing the confrontation between police and the gunman who killed five people at a Louisville bank is expected to be released Tuesday evening.   Meantime, police are uncovering new details about the shooter. The department's chief said that the gun used in the attack was purchased less than a week ago. Here's what to know to get up to speed: Timeline: The entire incident lasted about 9 minutes, Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said. The shooting began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, according to a manager at the bank. The shooter fired his weapon for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived, according to a city official. When officers got there, they shot and killed the gunman, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department.
The weapon: The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, which was purchased six days ago, police said. He bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Police also said they executed a search warrant on his house and recovered some other items. Gwinn-Villaroel would not specify what they were.
Video of the shooting: The responding officer's body camera footage is expected to be released Tuesday evening, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Police also said the shooter live-streamed the incident on Instagram. Meta, the parent company of the platform, said that video was taken down. A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.
Dispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. "He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal," the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.
Victims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. 
Hospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.
Calls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow "weary."
Vigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shootingheadline:More than half of US adults or their families have been impacted by a gun-related incident, new survey shows</teiHeader><text>A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot.

Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police.

He then called out the Republicans for working harder on identify politics than on gun reform.  McGarvey said things like getting "weapons of war off our streets" and "helping people who are in crisis" are not a "political issue," but "it becomes one when Kentucky Republicans would rather ban books and pronouns and then make Kentucky a sanctuary state for weapons."

Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.
Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
Investigation: Police did not have "any prior engagement" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman live streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.
Victims: Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.
Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and state Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was "one of my closest friends" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:What we covered here</teiHeader><text>Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, was found guilty Tuesday of all four counts of involuntary manslaughter in a novel legal case that stood as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.
Crumbley, 45, faces up to 15 years in prison, and her sentencing hearing is set for April 9. She has been behind bars since her arrest in a Detroit warehouse days after the shooting.
Her husband, James Crumbley, is scheduled to go to trial on the same charges in early March. Our live coverage has ended.

The shooter's father, James Crumbley, is set to go to trial next month. There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting. For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail. In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm. But, the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different. In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual. Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:Jury foreperson said Jennifer Crumbley being the last adult seen with the gun "really hammered it home"</teiHeader><text>The jury foreperson in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley — the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021 — said the fact that Crumbley was the last adult seen with the gun before the shooting “really hammered it home.”  “Lives hung in the balance, and we took that very seriously,” the woman, who identified herself as the foreperson in the courtroom and who read the jury's verdict, said. She declined to give her name. She said “both sides were well represented” when asked whether the jurors had to convince each other while deliberating.  During her closing arguments, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald put up a photo of Jennifer Crumbley leaving the gun range on November 27, 2021, carrying the gun in a case that her son used in the shooting. “This is the last picture we have of that gun until we see it murder four kids on November 30, and the person holding it is Jennifer Crumbley. She’s the last person we see with that gun,” McDonald said.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:James Crumbley's trial is expected to begin next month</teiHeader><text>James Crumbley, whose son killed four people in a mass shooting at a Michigan high school in 2021, is set to go to trial on March 5. He has pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for his alleged role in the shooting. It comes after the shooter's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was found guilty of the same charges on Tuesday. The evidence and arguments in James Crumbley's trial may differ. At first, they had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split. Why this is important: In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths — a novel and unusual legal theory.  Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:Jennifer Crumbley's case looked to expand the scope of blame in shootings. Here's what happened at trial</teiHeader><text>Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter Tuesday afternoon. She pleaded not guilty to all four counts for her role in the November 30, 2021, mass shooting at Oxford High School, which left four students dead and seven other people wounded, including a teacher.  Here's what both sides argued during the trial: The prosecution argued Crumbley was responsible for the deaths because she was “grossly negligent” in giving a gun to her son Ethan, who was 15 at the time, and failing to get him proper mental health treatment despite warning signs. Over a week of testimony, law enforcement officials, school employees, shooting victims and those who knew Jennifer Crumbley testified for the prosecution.  
The defense argued the blame laid elsewhere: on her husband for improperly securing the firearm; on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s behavioral issues; and on Ethan himself, who planned and carried out the attack on his own. Defense attorney Shannon Smith said the case was “dangerous” for parents everywhere. During her trial, Jennifer Crumbley took the stand in her own defense and said she wouldn't have done anything differently.
The big picture: Broadly, the prosecution’s case relied on an unusual and novel legal strategy and represents an attempt to expand the scope of blame in mass shootings. And in its specifics, the trial provided an intimate view of the collapse of one American family. Crumbley’s husband, James, is scheduled to go on trial on the same charges in early March.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:Father of Oxford shooting victim calls today's verdict "a step toward accountability"</teiHeader><text>Craig Shilling, the father of Justin Shilling, one of the four students killed in the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School, said the guilty verdict for the mother of the shooter was emotional. “It was a long time coming, but it's definitely a step toward accountability," Shilling told reporters outside the courtroom on Tuesday. Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter and is set to be sentenced on April 9. Each count carries a maximum punishment of up to 15 years in prison, which would run concurrently.  He said parents need to address “things at every level” and there’s “no way to look the other way” now. In the case of Jennifer Crumbley, the father said many things could have stopped the shooting before it started. "You cannot choose to take your own interests over your child, especially when it comes to mental health and addressing, you know, concerns, the problem. Everything about that was disturbing," Shilling said.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:Prosecutor hugged and shook hands with families of victims after verdict was read</teiHeader><text>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald hugged the fathers of Justin Shilling and Madisyn Baldwin before she left the courtroom.

Here's what they were: The jury sent their first question after deliberating for just over two hours: The jury sought for clarification on instructions, asking if there are different ways to convict Crumbley. Judge Cheryl Matthews decided to tell them yes, and referred the jury to re-read part of her instructions, which says “the prosecutor asserts two different theories to support the charges of Involuntary Manslaughter.” The first theory is that Crumbley committed involuntary manslaughter because she failed to perform a legal duty. The second, is because she was grossly negligent.  "Those theories are two different ways to prove the same crime. Either or both of these theories, if proven, are sufficient to establish the crime of involuntary manslaughter," the instructions explain. The second question came an hour later: The jury asked if they can infer anything from evidence or witnesses that the prosecution did not bring, specifically not bring in the shooter or other people who could answer how specifically Ethan Crumbley got the gun. Judge Matthews brought the jury in to tell them they can only consider the evidence that was brought in at trial.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:JUST IN: Jury has reached verdict in Jennifer Crumbley manslaughter trial</teiHeader><text>A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021, in a trial that stands as a test of the limits of who’s responsible for a school shooting.  She faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter.

In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory. In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Oxford school shooter, found guiltyheadline:Jennifer Crumbley's son has already been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2021 shooting</teiHeader><text>A jury has reached a verdict in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the teenager who killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021.

In that sentencing, Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwamé Rowe dismissed last-minute defense pleas that Crumbley’s life is salvageable and noted that the “defendant in his own words” told the court “this is nobody’s fault but his own.” Rowe said victim Justin Shilling, 17, was shot at point-blank range after being told by the defendant to get on his knees. Hana St. Juliana, 14, was shot a second time after she was down, he said, “to finish the job by shooting her again.” “That is an execution. That is torture. He shot most people multiple times. And, as he wrote, he did this for notoriety.

Jennifer Crumbley wrote the messages as part of a lengthy conversation with Brian Meloche, a firefighter captain who testified he was in an extramarital romantic relationship with her at the time of the shooting. In several messages shown in court Wednesday, Jennifer Crumbley stated how the firearm used in the shooting was stored and secured. On the morning of the shooting, she said she had to go to her son’s school because she was worried he “was going to do something dumb,” Meloche testified. He responded by asking where her firearm was, and Jennifer said the gun was in her vehicle, he testified. However, other testimony has shown that the gun was in Ethan Crumbley’s backpack at school. Meloche also testified that he recalled telling Jennifer Crumbley to call 911 when she realized the gun was missing. He acknowledged that he deleted these and other messages from Facebook.

But there is still a lot that police do not know as the investigation gets underway into a tragic ending to a festive day in the Missouri city. The shooting, which happened after a parade and rally for the Chiefs, is at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Here's what we know so far: Victims: There are at least 22 people with gunshot wounds, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said. One of those people has died, said Kansas City Fire Department Interim Chief Ross Grundyson. Some of the shooting victims were children, he added. Officials are still working to identify the person killed.   What we know about the condition of the survivors: 8 had immediately life-threatening injuries and were transported to hospitals within 10 minutes, according to Grundyson.
7 had life-threatening injuries
6 had minor injuries What happened: The shooting happened on the west side of Union Station in downtown Kansas City, Graves said. Though witnesses described watching officers run into the surrounding buildings, the police chief said the incident happened outside. When officers arrived on the scene, they immediately started helping people who were hurt. People detained: Graves said police have detained three people for further investigation. She said earlier that officers detained two people when they arrived at the scene, with officers even chasing one person. A video has circulated which shows "some fans tackling someone," she said. Authorities are trying to determine if one of the detained individuals is the same person featured in the video. Graves also said police have recovered firearms.

"You have a huge crowd and likely a large, you know, significant portion of that population carrying firearms. So any conflict or dispute can easily turn into a shooting and then you have what we saw today, and that's assuming it wasn't sort of a targeted or directed effort by people for political or other reasons," he said.

At least one person was killed and up to more than a dozen others were injured in a shooting after a rally near Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, police said. The shooting is at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Officials are expected to give another update soon on the investigation. Here's what we know so far: Victims: One person is dead and up to 15 others are wounded after the shooting, according to Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves. All Kansas City Chiefs players, coaches and staff are safe and accounted for, Mayor Quinton Lucas said.
What happened: The shooting erupted on the west side of Union Station, Graves said. When officers got there, they took two armed people into custody and immediately started helping people who were hurt. Officials are in the beginning stages of figuring out what happened, Graves said, and law enforcement is working to clear surrounding areas. The White House said President Joe Biden has been briefed and federal law enforcement is helping local law enforcement.   Eyewitness accounts: One woman said she was standing to the right of the stage when the shooting happened. She described the confusion of the crowd and seeing police run into buildings around Union Station and swarm a stairwell. She also said she heard "pop" sounds. Madison Anderes, 24, who attended the Super Bowl parade with her brother and mother, said she felt like she "was going to die."
Reactions: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said on social media that he is praying for his city. Chiefs guard Trey Smith also said his "thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by today's incidents." Chiefs defensive tackle Mike Pennel and offensive tackle Donovan Smith both said on social media that they too are praying after the incident. 
The celebration before the shooting: The parade started with Chiefs players crowded on double-decker buses, waving to fans as they rolled through the city. Players also left their rides to walk the parade route, high-fiving fans and some even handing out a few libations to people who had been waiting throughout the morning to cheer on the Chiefs. A pep rally following the parade featured several players toasting the team’s connection with the city.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Chiefs Super Bowl rally shooting leaves one dead and multiple injuredheadline:The Kansas City shooting marks the 48th mass shooting in 2024</teiHeader><text>Today's shooting in Kansas City is at least the 48th mass shooting in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. 
Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
Investigation: Police did not have "any prior engagement" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are "hopeful" that they can get the footage taken offline.
Victims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.

The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”  The comments came hours after four people were killed in a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.  Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.  Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”  She said Biden has "done a historic amount of work recently" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.  She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all.

Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile. A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: April 10, 2023: Louisville, Kentucky shootingheadline:Kentucky governor orders all flags to half-staff to honor victims of Louisville shooting</teiHeader><text>All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov.

Janet Mills governor, who met her husband in Lewiston, described it as a “special place.” President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with Maine lawmakers and “offered full federal support in the wake of this horrific attack,” the White House said in a statement. Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline is “heartbroken for our city and our people,” he said. “Lewiston is known for our strength and grit and we will need both in the days to come.” Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President Shanna Cox on Thursday called the scene of both attacks “family locations.” “It was family league activity at the bowling alley. The likeliness of this having direct impact for so many here is so real.” Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque lost friends in the shooting, he told “CNN This Morning.” A teenager who went to school with his son was shot and is expected to recover, he said. “There’s going to be very few people in this community that have not been touched by this,” he said. “It’s going to be with me for the rest of my life, and it’s really hard for me to explain that.” “The other folks that I knew that were there either as witnesses or family members of witnesses; it’s obviously traumatic,” Levesque said. “The bright spot was seeing individuals reunified with their loved ones after not knowing for so long, but on the on the other side, the ones that were waiting and waiting, probably would never be reunified.”</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Father of 2-year-old identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston mass shootings</teiHeader><text>Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar and Grille when he was killed during Wednesday’s mass shooting in Lewiston, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.  Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees, his brother said. “It’s just surreal and sad.

She said it is a "dynamic situation on the ground" and that the administration's priority is "to make sure that Maine and local enforcement has the resources that it needs." She said Greg Jackson, the deputy director of the White House office of Gun Violence Prevention, convened federal agencies Thursday morning “to discuss federal resources already deployed and ensure readiness to meet any additional community needs as the people of Lewiston work through the unimaginable grief that they may be experiencing.”</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Law enforcement response time is missing from Lewiston shootings timeline</teiHeader><text>Maine officials released a timeline of events surrounding Wednesday's deadly shooting rampage at two locations in Lewiston, Maine, which did not include police response time to the incidents. “That information will come out in an after-action review,” Maine Department of Public Safety Public Information Officer Shannon Moss explained, adding that law enforcement is focused on apprehending the suspect and an “after action review” was conducted after most “critical events.” Here's the timeline provided by the Maine Department of Public Safety: At 6:56 p.m., Wednesday, October 25, 2023: Auburn Communications Center was notified that a man walked into the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley on Mollison Street in Lewiston and began shooting.

Police said Card should be considered armed and dangerous, urging residents to shelter in place and report any suspicious activity to authorities. Harris noted that, in the United States, firearm deaths are the leading cause of death for children, warning, “Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.”  Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. “And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way — as our friends in Australia have demonstrated,” Harris added.

This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”   The 40-year-old Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday. He has no combat deployments, according to the records.   Clifford Steeves of Massachusetts told CNN he knew Card when they served in the Army Reserve together, starting in the early 2000s until about a decade ago. He said he never witnessed any concerning behavior from Card.  “He was a very nice guy — very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”  Steeves said the two served together around the country at different points, including in Wisconsin, Georgia and New York. He said he felt as though he “grew up” with Card because they entered the Army as young men and trained together.   Steeves said that while “aggressive leadership was very prominent” in the Army, Card stuck out for being a “rational, understanding person” who “led through respect rather than fear.”  Steeves said Card never saw combat but had extensive training, including firearms training and land navigation, “so he would be very comfortable in the woods.” He described Card as an “outdoors type of guy” and a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.  Another former Army Reserve member who served with Card also described him as a “nice guy” who “never had an issue with anybody.” The servicemember, who asked to speak anonymously due to the sensitivity of the situation, did not recall Card showing any kind of violent behavior.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Maine senator says she's in touch with Biden and administration officials to coordinate response to rampage</teiHeader><text>GOP Sen.

Bean employed more than 3,000 people across Maine as of the first quarter, according to state statistics.  Remember: Another major employer, Hannaford Supermarkets, has also closed all of its stores in Maine until at least 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, the company said on Facebook.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: October 25, 2023 - Lewiston, Maine mass shootingsheadline:Lisbon police chief urges residents to report "anything suspicious" as search continues after shootings</teiHeader><text>Authorities are searching Lisbon following mass shootings Wednesday in the neighboring city of Lewiston, the town’s police chief says. “Please reach out if you see something suspicious, if something isn't right,” Chief Ryan McGee told reporters Thursday morning as he described the situation in Lisbon as an "active scene."  McGee's officers have been chasing leads throughout the night and morning, he said. A “vehicle of interest” was found in Lisbon, law enforcement said.

State officials say the shootings began around 6:56 p.m. ET. Eyewitnesses described seeing people running away from the bowling alley. Lewiston is about 36 miles north of Portland and is the state’s second-largest city. A local councilor who spoke to CNN said the death toll could be as high as 22.

The nonprofit and CNN define mass shootings as those in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nearly 1 in 5 US adults have had a family member killed by a gun, including homicides and suicides, according to a 2023 survey from KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation). About the same proportion of adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. More background: The FBI defines “mass murder” as the murder of four or more people and tracks “active shooter incidents,” but there is no federal or agreed-upon definition for a mass shooting. For all its data background, the Gun Violence Archive’s work is, at its heart, basic journalism. Researchers scrape data automatically from about 7,500 law enforcement agencies, media outlets and more organizations, the executive director Mark Bryant told CNN in 2022. They then comb through the results, double-check media sources, follow up with police, and add that information to the database. Most shootings are added to the system within about 72 hours, Bryant said.

Eyewitnesses described seeing people, including children, flee from the location and being patted down outside by police officers. There was also footage of first responders loading a victim into an ambulance outside the business. The business lies just off the main highway that runs through Lewiston. Amenities include a bar and dining area that serves pizzas and burgers, according to its website. It also offers packages for birthday parties and corporate events, it says.  Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant, the second shooting location, hosts parties, family celebrations and corporate events — with an arcade area that includes dart boards and pool tables, according to its website.

And we grieve for those whose lives were tragically lost in this heinous act of violence,” Bates College said in a statement late Wednesday, referring to the mass shooting. Lewiston is the second biggest city in Maine, after Portland, and sits on the banks of the Androscoggin River.  And though Maine is the whitest state in the nation, according to the 2020 census, immigrant communities have grown in size recently, as well as in other states including Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington.  Between 2017 and 2021, more than 7% of Lewiston residents were foreign-born, according to the census — still lower than the national average of nearly 14%.

Here's what we know so far: More than a dozen victims: At least eight people were killed and seven more were wounded in the massacre, local officials said. Victims ranged in age from 5 to 61 years old, according to a Dallas-area medical group. A father who rushed to be with his son at the mall described the horror that awaited him there.
Police killed the gunman: An officer was already at the mall for an unrelated call when the gunfire broke out, the Allen police chief said Saturday. The officer followed the sound of gunshots, tracked down the shooter and killed him, according to the chief.
The shooter's background: The gunman, who dressed in tactical gear, has been identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Garcia had been living in some kind of temporary housing in the Dallas area, the source said. He used to work as a security guard and had received firearms training in that role, according to an official database.
The gunman's weapons: The shooter was armed with an AR-15 style rifle and had at least one other weapon on him when he was gunned down by police, a senior law enforcement source told CNN. Police also found multiple weapons in his car.
Potential extremist ties: Authorities are investigating whether the shooter was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source said. Authorities have not zeroed in on a specific motive, but the source said the shooter was found with an insignia on his clothing that read "RWDS" — an acronym known to watch groups — potentially standing for "Right Wing Death Squad." He also had an extensive social media presence that included neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts, according to the official.
What we're still waiting for: More word directly from Texas officials. Authorities did not hold an official news conference Sunday, and have released little information about their investigation. The FBI told CNN Sunday the Texas Department of Public Safety is the lead agency in the mass shooting investigation.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 deadheadline:A father rushed to the Allen outlet mall after getting a call from his son. He arrived to a horrifying scene</teiHeader><text>Editor’s Note: This post contains graphic descriptions of the shooting’s aftermath. A veteran and former police officer described the haunting scenes he found when he arrived at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas, Saturday. The aftermath of the mass shooting there was “horrific,” Steven Spainhouer told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. The former Army officer said he wouldn’t wish it upon anyone to see or experience what he did. Spainhouer said he was planning to meet his son, who works at the H&M store at the outlet mall, for lunch. His son called to tell him about the active shooter and that he was sheltered in the break room at the store. Spainhouer drove to the outlet mall and said when he showed up, he saw many people fleeing the scene and counted seven bodies on the ground. He rushed up to different victims to check for a pulse, and said he witnessed one woman who had “nothing left of her face or head, it was gone.” Spainhouer performed chest compressions on another victim, who coughed up blood and then died, he told CNN. Then he saw a young child who crawled out from underneath one of the victims and was “caked with blood from head to toe,” Spainhouer said. The child kept saying that his mother was hurt. The father, who has personal and professional experience handling firearms, said the horror he found at the mall will repeat itself if lawmakers don't limit the access of certain weapons to the public. Spainhouer added that both he and his son will receive counseling for what they witnessed Saturday. Allen police subsequently disputed parts of Spainhouer's account, noting "inconsistencies" between his media interviews and the facts of the investigation. The department said it conducted a follow-up interview with Spainhouer and "determined that [he] is not a credible incident witness." According to the police department, Spainhouer did not perform CPR, and did not move a deceased mother who was covering a child who survived the shooting. In response, Spainhouer stood by his account, said he was "hurt and disappointed," and clarified that "a small child pulled himself from under a victim and I assisted him to a safe space away from the area." This article was updated on May 16 to reflect the Allen Police Department's statement disputing parts of Steven Spainhouer's eyewitness account — and Spainhouer's response to the police press release.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 deadheadline:Source: Authorities investigating Texas mall shooter's possible extremist motivations</teiHeader><text>Authorities are investigating whether the Allen, Texas, outlet mall shooter was motivated by right-wing extremism, a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.

As the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors and reports on extremism, has noted in the past, some members of extremist groups have been seen in recent years with patches bearing the same letters.

Garcia was approved to work as a commissioned security guard in Texas from April 2016 until April 2020, when his license expired, according to the Texas Online Private Security database, maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. His profile shows he worked for at least three security companies. None of those companies immediately responded to requests for comment.  According to the database, Garcia received Level II  and Level III security training. The former covers security laws in Texas; the latter, which is required for all commissioned security officers in Texas, includes firearm training and the demonstration of firearm proficiency, according to Jonah Nathan, vice president of Ranger Guard, a security guard service in Texas not affiliated with Garcia’s employers. In 2018, Garcia also completed a separate firearms proficiency training course, which requires six hours of continuing education, according to the Texas DPS database.  Private security guards in Texas undergo background checks and are disqualified if they have committed certain crimes, such as assault, burglary or sexual offenses, among others, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety website and state codes. They are also disqualified if they have been dishonorably discharged from the US military; have been found incompetent by a court of law; or have been required to register as a sex offender. It’s unclear why Garcia’s license expired. A police officer killed the gunman outside the outlet mall after he carried out the massacre Saturday, according to the Allen police chief. The shooting left at least least eight people dead and seven others wounded.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 deadheadline:NHL’s Dallas Stars cancel watch party due to recent shooting in Allen, Texas</teiHeader><text>The National Hockey League’s Dallas Stars have canceled Sunday’s playoff game watch party "out of respect for the victims" of the mall shooting in Allen, Texas.</text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader>eventName: Live updates: Allen, Texas, shooting at outlet mall leaves at least 8 deadheadline:Multiple people wounded in Texas mass shooting are being treated at local hospitals, police say</teiHeader><text>At least four patients injured in Saturday's mass shooting in Allen, Texas, are being treated at Medical City McKinney hospital near the Dallas suburb, police said in a news release Sunday.

I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe," he added. Biden said yesterday's violence "is too shocking to be so familiar."  He also said he is grateful for the first responders on the scene, and that he has directed federal agencies to provide support to local officials as needed.  Biden ordered flags at the White House and other federal buildings to half-staff to honor the victims through May 11.  News of the shooting emerged yesterday evening as Biden headed to church.

"There’s always telltale signs before, there’s indicators should have looked out for," he said.  Cuellar added that strict gun control measures have not ended mass shootings in blue states around the country, arguing more needs to be done to get to the root of the issue.  Some context: The attack in Allen, Texas, is one of at least 199 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been wounded or killed, excluding a gunman. Texas has loosened restrictions on gun ownership in recent years amid several high-profile mass shootings that have devastated its communities. In 2021, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. A 2022 study found that states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. Correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified Rep. Henry Cuellar's political party.
